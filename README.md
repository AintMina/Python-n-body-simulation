Python n-body simulation that I did out of boredom.

The simulation does not utilize GPU and only run on one CPU core, so this is mostly to test if you CPU fans are working.

The program uses pygame to display the sim, so pygame needs to be installed with pip.

Enjoy! Or not, I'm not the boss of you.
